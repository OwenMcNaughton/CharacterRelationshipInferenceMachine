# Character Relationship Inference Machine

### What is?
Sort of grep for character names in a text, and then grep for other names near
that name, and make a graph of character relationships. Uses d3.js's force-
directed graph.

### How do I?
Go to http://owenmcnaughton.github.io/CharacterRelationshipInferenceMachine/ and
paste in a screenplay or book or something in the first box. Then add some
comma-separated character names in the box below, then press the button.
